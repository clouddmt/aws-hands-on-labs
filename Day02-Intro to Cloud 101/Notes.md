## Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources such as compute,
storage, databases, and networking over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Key benefits:
- Scalability
- Cost efficiency
- High availability
- Flexibility

## Introduction to AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud platform that provides a wide range
of services including compute, storage, networking, security, and analytics.
AWS operates on a global infrastructure with regions and availability zones.
