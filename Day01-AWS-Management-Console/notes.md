## AWS Management Console Notes

### What is the AWS Management Console?
The AWS Management Console is a browser-based interface that provides
access to AWS services and resources. It allows users to manage AWS
infrastructure without writing code.

### AWS Account Structure
- Root user: Full access (not recommended for daily use)
- IAM users: Limited access based on permissions
- IAM roles: Temporary access for services or users

---

### Regions and Availability Zones
- AWS regions are geographic locations
- Each region contains multiple Availability Zones
- Resources are created in a specific region
- Region selection affects cost, latency, and availability

---

### Console Navigation
- Services menu groups AWS services by category
- Recently used services are displayed
- Search bar helps locate services quickly
- Dashboards show resource summaries

### Observations
- Region must be selected carefully before creating resources
- Permissions control what is visible in the console
- Most AWS services provide monitoring and logs via the console

### Console vs CLI
- Console is best for learning and visualization
- CLI is better for automation and repeatability
- Best practice is to understand both
